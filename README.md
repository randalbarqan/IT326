# Predictive Models For Diabetes Risk Assessment
## project motivations 

We have chosen to work on a dataset of health indicators for diabetes based on the prevalence of this disease. Diabetes is a chronic disease that leads to various health complications and economic problems, necessitating a strong response to address the disease. Additionally, we believe that our work on this dataset can have an impact on promoting public health.
