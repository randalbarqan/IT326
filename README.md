# About project


By this project we aim to use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to develop predictive models for diabetes risk assessment.

We chose to work on the diabetes risk assessment problem with the BRFSS dataset due to the widespread impact of diabetes on public health and the economy. Our goal is to develop predictive models that can identify individuals at risk early on, enabling timely interventions and improved health outcomes. By leveraging the rich data provided by the BRESS survey, we aim to contribute to addressing this critical health chal 
data provided by the BRFSS survey, we aim to contribute to addressing this critical health challenge and making a meaningful difference in healthcare.
