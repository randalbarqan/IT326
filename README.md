# IT326 Diabetes Health Indicators
#### About project


By this project we aim to use the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset to develop predictive models for diabetes risk assessment.

We chose to work on the diabetes risk assessment problem with the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset due to the widespread impact of diabetes on public health and the economy. Our goal is to develop predictive models that can identify individuals at risk early on, enabling timely interventions and improved health outcomes. By leveraging the rich data provided by the BRESS survey, we aim to contribute to addressing this critical health chal data,and contribute to addressing this critical health challenge and making a meaningful difference in healthcare.
